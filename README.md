# Concrete Strength Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project is a concrete strength prediction model implemented using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in R. Given various input parameters such as slag, water, ash, and more, the model predicts the strength of concrete. This README provides an overview of the project, how to get started, usage instructions, and more.

## About

In many construction projects, understanding the strength of concrete is crucial. This project offers a solution by providing an ANN-based model for predicting concrete strength. It uses a dataset containing various input parameters related to concrete composition and age to make predictions.



### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- R (https://www.r-project.org/) installed on your machine.
- Required R packages (install them using `install.packages("package_name")`):
  - neuralnet
  - ggplot2

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TosifAN/concrete_data.git
   ```

2. Change the working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd concrete-data
   ```

3. Open RStudio or an R environment.

4. Open the R script (e.g., `concrete_data.R`) and run the code to train and test the ANN model.

## Usage

1. After installation and running the script, you can use the trained ANN model to predict concrete strength by providing input parameters such as slag, water, ash, etc.

2. Customize the input parameters in the script to make predictions for specific scenarios.

## Model Details

- The neural network model used in this project has been trained on the provided dataset.
- The model architecture and hyperparameters can be customized as needed.
- Evaluation metrics and model performance can be found in the code.
